# 🚀 Node.js Learning Journey

This repository documents my structured learning path through **Node.js**, from beginner fundamentals to advanced concepts like event loops, asynchronous patterns, and module systems.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

| Phase | Concept | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ | **File System (fs)** | Synchronous and asynchronous file operations |
| 2️⃣ | **Event Loop** | Understanding non-blocking I/O, callbacks, and timers |
| 3️⃣ | **Asynchronous Patterns** | Using Promises, async/await, and blocking vs non-blocking examples |
| 4️⃣ | **Modules** | Import/export, CommonJS, and working with external libraries |
